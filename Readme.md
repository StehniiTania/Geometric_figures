<br/>• Load() - reading a figure from a file.
<br/>Define derived classes:
<br/>• Square - a square, which is characterized by the coordinates of the left
top corner and side length;
<br/>• Rectangle - a rectangle with the given coordinates of the top
left corner and dimensions;
<br/>• Circle — a circle with specified center coordinates and radius;
<br/>• Ellipse — an ellipse with the given coordinates of the upper corner of the described
around it a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes,
and the dimensions of this rectangle. 
<br/>Create an array of shapes, save the shapes to a file, load into another array, and display information about each of the shapes.
